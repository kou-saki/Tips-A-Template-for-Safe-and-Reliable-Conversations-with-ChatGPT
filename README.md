# A Template for Safe and Reliable Conversations with ChatGPT

This repository contains a reusable prompt template designed to improve the **clarity, transparency, and trustworthiness** of ChatGPT’s responses.

The template provides a structured format that encourages the model to clearly distinguish facts from speculation, separate its reasoning from conclusions, and communicate uncertainty when needed. This helps reduce the risk of hallucinations and supports more accurate, understandable interactions—especially valuable for users new to AI tools or those sharing AI-generated responses with others.
